# Rails Directory Structure

## 1. Theoretical Explanation

Ruby on Rails follows a convention over configuration principle, which is reflected in its standardized directory structure. Understanding this structure is crucial for efficient development and maintenance of Rails applications.

### Main Directories:

- `app/`: Contains the core of your application (models, views, controllers, helpers, etc.)
- `config/`: Configuration files for your application, database, routes, etc.
- `db/`: Database-related files, including migrations and seeds
- `lib/`: Library modules and custom code
- `log/`: Application log files
- `public/`: Static files accessible to the public
- `test/` or `spec/`: Test files (depending on your testing framework)
- `tmp/`: Temporary files
- `vendor/`: Third-party code

### Key Subdirectories in `app/`:

- `controllers/`: Controller files that handle requests
- `models/`: Model files that interact with the database
- `views/`: View templates for rendering responses
- `helpers/`: Helper modules for views
- `assets/`: JavaScript, CSS, and image files
- `mailers/`: Classes for sending emails

## 2. Hands-on Exercise

Let's create a new Rails application and explore its directory structure.

1. Open your terminal and run:

```bash
rails new my_blog
cd my_blog
```

2. Examine the created directories using:

```bash
ls -la
```

3. Explore specific directories:

```bash
ls app
ls config
ls db
```

4. Create a new controller:

```bash
rails generate controller Articles index show
```

5. Observe the new files created in `app/controllers/`, `app/views/`, and `config/routes.rb`.

## 3. Real-world Example: Blog Application

Let's consider a simple blog application to understand how different components fit into the Rails directory structure:

- Models (`app/models/`):
  - `article.rb`
  - `comment.rb`
  - `user.rb`

- Controllers (`app/controllers/`):
  - `articles_controller.rb`
  - `comments_controller.rb`
  - `users_controller.rb`

- Views (`app/views/`):
  - `articles/index.html.erb`
  - `articles/show.html.erb`
  - `comments/_form.html.erb`

- Routes (`config/routes.rb`):

```ruby
Rails.application.routes.draw do
  resources :articles do
    resources :comments
  end
  resources :users
end
```

- Database Migration (`db/migrate/`):
  - `20240109000000_create_articles.rb`
  - `20240109000001_create_comments.rb`
  - `20240109000002_create_users.rb`

This structure allows for easy navigation and maintainability of the blog application.
